README in Japanese is [here](https://github.com/UchidaMizuki/jpcity/blob/main/README-ja.md).

jpcity is an R package for reading and converting Japanese municipality codes.
This package provides the following features,

- Read city codes: `parse_city()`.
  - city and prefecture names can be obtained by combining `city_name()` and `pref_name()`.
- Convert to city codes at a different point in time: `city_convert()`
- Combine wards of designated cities or divide them into wards: `city_desig_merge()`，`city_desig_split()`
- Get city codes at a specific point in time: `get_city()`
- Find city codes using the name of the prefecture or city: `find_city()`

## Installation

You can install the development version of jpcity from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("UchidaMizuki/jpcity")
```

## Examples

```{r setup, message=FALSE}
library(jpcity)
library(tidyverse)
```

### Read city codes

```{r parse_city}
city <- parse_city(c("13101", "27101", "23101"))

# Override the interval using `when` argument
city <- parse_city(c("13101", "27101", "23101"),
                   when = "1989-02-12")
city

tibble(city = city,
       pref_name = pref_name(city),
       city_name = city_name(city),
       city_name_kana = city_name(city,
                                  kana = TRUE))
```

### Convert to city codes at a different point in time

```{r city_convert}
city <- parse_city(c("13101", "27101", "23101"),
                   when = "1980-01-01")
tibble(city_from = city,
       city_to = city_convert(city,
                              from = "1980-01-01",
                              to = "2020-01-01")) |> 
  unnest(city_to)

city <- parse_city("15100",
                   when = "2020-01-01")
tibble(city_from = city,
       city_to = city_convert(city,
                              from = "2020-01-01",
                              to = "1970-04-01")) |> 
  unnest(city_to)
```

### Combine wards of designated cities or divide them into wards

```{r city_desig_merge-city_desig_split}
city <- parse_city(c("13101", "27101", "23101"),
                   when = "1980-01-01")
tibble(city = city,
       city_desig = city_desig_merge(city),
       city_desig_merge_tokyo = city_desig_merge(city,
                                                 merge_tokyo = TRUE))
```

### Get city codes at a specific point in time

```{r get_city}
tibble(city = get_city("2020-01-01"))

tibble(city = get_city("1970-04-01"))
```

### Find city codes using the name of the prefecture or city

```{r find_city}
find_city(c("東京都", "新宿区"))
```
